# MarkDocEditor Design Requirements

This document defines the design and functional specifications for MarkDocEditor, the official IDE for structured Markdown project authoring within MarkDocSuite.

## 1. Functional Requirements

* The preview engine shall support MathJax and Mermaid injections.

### 1.4 Project Management

* Projects shall support hierarchical document trees.
* The system shall track metadata, assets, and configuration per project.
* Each project shall be exportable to its respective compiler format (`.mdproj` → `.mdg`, `.mbkproj` → `.mbk`).

### 1.5 Validation and Quality

* The editor shall include built-in structural and style validation.
* It shall highlight and list violations within the editor.
* Plugin-based validators shall be optionally loadable.

### 1.6 Build Integration

  * Sidebar extensions
  * Render modifiers

### 1.8 AI Features

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Performance

* Projects up to 100 documents shall load in under 1s.
* Markdown edits shall re-render in <200ms.

### 2.2 Portability

* The system shall run on Windows and macOS desktops.
* It shall use self-contained deployment for offline use.

### 2.3 Accessibility

* Keyboard navigation, high-contrast themes, and screen reader compatibility are required.

### 2.4 Stability

* Editor state shall autosave at regular intervals.
* Crashes shall not affect project file integrity.

## 3. Technical Constraints

* Built using .NET 8 + .NET MAUI
* Rendering via Markdig + WebView2
* Build interface with MarkDocCompiler via CLI or internal API call
* Plugins written in C# and declared via shared manifest
